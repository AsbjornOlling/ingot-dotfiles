# Ingot-dotfiles

This is where I keep the dotfiles for my Macbook Air.
Feel free to grab and use whatever you want - just don't hold me responsible for anything.

# Switch.sh
In the Scripts dir, there's a script called switch.sh. This script replaces (in some cases puts together) config files, to make either a dark or a light rice. Syntax is: switch.sh [dark / light]

# Color scheme
I used ashes.light and ashes.dark respectively.
I'm sure you can google your way to finding the creator / origin of it. I just found it on terminal.sexy.
